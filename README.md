# Introduction 
Korean written language called "한글" (Hangul) is a composition of two to three individual characters.  
"Hello" in Korean is "안녕", and you can clearly see there are three components to each characteristic.  
"안 -> ㅇㅏㄴ" and "녕 -> ㄴㅕㅇ"  
* I will use First, Middle, and Final characters to identify the three characters.  
(Check : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul for better terms and information.)  


Let's go back to "안녕" to demonstrate.  
안녕's 안 is made up of First : ㅇ Middle :ㅏ Final : ㄴ, and each characters can be typed with one keystroke.  
Because Korean keyboard layout is essentially just an overlay on the English QWERTY keyboard, it is easy to convert.

It works by decomposing the Korean characteristic into individual characters, and matching them with English QWERTY layout.
